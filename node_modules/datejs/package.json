It hasn't changed for \nthree years, so hopefully it won't be too much of a maintenance nightmare.\n\nI've just included all of the non-US locales in lib - I've not written any way \nto access them yet.\n\nWhat I'll probably do is create a wrapper which defaults to en-US, but can be\ncalled with other locales.\n\nI am not the author of datejs.  I'm just maintaining an NPM package of it, as I\nneeded one.\n",
